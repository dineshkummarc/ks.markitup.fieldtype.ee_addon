h2. Configuration


h2. MarkItUp Sets Installation

If you'd like to use a different markup set, such as Textile or Markdown, you'll have to do some additional configuration:

# Go to http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/downloads/
# Download the zip file
# Unzip it in your markItUp sets folder
# Set a nameSpace for the new set in the set.js file. (see the default set.js for an example)
# In the set.js file, where it says *mySettings = {*, change "mySettings" to a unique name.
# Add your nameSpace class for each line in the style.css file. (see the default style.css for an example)
# Create an init.js file in your set's directory.
# Add this short script to the init.js file:
  <pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    $('.ksmarkitup-default').markItUp(defaultSettings);
  });
  </code></pre>
# In the above script, change the first "default" to the name of your set's directory. Change "defaultSettings" to the unique name you gave to the settings object in your set.js file.
